# Day 10 - Introducting an RGB LED (no code today)

# Requirements
1. Just an RGB LED is essential

# Summary of Steps
1. __Some basic info on an RGB-LED__
When you look at is first is looks more boring than other LEDs which are at least colourful. 
However, the extra wires that go into the LED show that this is something more useful. 
inside the usual LED package, there are actually three LEDs, one red, one green and yes, one blue. 
By controlling the brightness of each of the individual LEDs you can mix pretty much any color you want.


2. __RGB LED Leads__ The RGB LED has four leads.
There is one lead going to the positive connection of each of the single LEDs within the package and 
a single lead that is connected to all three negative sides of the LEDs.

3. __Which lead is which__
The common negative connection of the LED package is the second pin from the flat side of the LED package. 
Can you find the flat side? Feel around the ring at the bottom of the LEd.
It is also the longest of the four leads. This lead will be connected to ground.

4. That's all for today... some code tomorrow...
