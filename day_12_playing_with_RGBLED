# Day 12 - Playing with an RGB LED (sorry no code again today)

# Requirements
1. An RGB LED
2. Resistors (2 same and maybe one of a different kind if possible)
3. Power source
4. Bread board
5. Some wires for connections

# Summary of Steps
1. __Let's make R, G and B__
To get one colour connect a lead through a resistor to power and 
the common negative connection of the LED package (second pin from the flat side and
the longest of the four leads) to ground.

Q: What colour is each lead?

2. __Let's try simple combinations__
Now try with two resistors and see what colours are made. 

Q: How many colours can you make?

3. __Now try with different resistors__ 
You can change the light from each LED by using a different resistor.

Q: Any thoughts on how this works?

4. That's all for today... Definately, some code tomorrow...
