# Let's get physical and assemble the circuit necessary to light up a wooden Christmas Tree

# Requirements
1. A two part wooden tree
2. Breadboard
3. Resistor
4. LEDs (up to five)
5. Male to female wires 
6. Battery
7. Batter Connector

# Summary of Steps
1. Assemble tree 
2. Put LED through the holes - wires may need to be stretched a little. 
3. When LED is through the hole use female connectors to LED to hold in place. 
4. Connect male end of connector to the breadboard.  
5. IMPORTANT: LED are directional - you need to put long end to the positive power.
6. Add resistor to the circuit from the positive power to the first LED. 
7. Add power: connect battery to the breadboard - put red into positive; black into negative

In this situation: we can connect in series or in parallel - maybe experiment with both?
Tomorrow: can we make the LED flash?
